# Lotofácil Lottery Game Generator 🎲

A Python script that generates balanced number combinations for Lotofácil (Brazilian lottery) and creates detailed PDF reports of the generated games.

## 📋 Features

- Generate multiple balanced Lotofácil games
- Automatic balancing of number frequency across games
- Detailed statistics for number occurrences
- PDF report generation with complete game information
- Smart distribution of numbers to ensure optimal combinations
- Real-time display of generated games and statistics

## 🔧 Prerequisites

To run this script, you need to have installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- ReportLab library for PDF generation
- Random and Collections (built-in Python libraries)

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lotofacil-generator.git
cd lotofacil-generator
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install reportlab
```

## 🎮 How to Use

1. Run the script:
```bash
python lotofacil_generator.py
```

2. Follow the terminal prompt:
   - Enter the number of games you want to generate
   - Wait for the processing to complete

3. The script will:
   - Generate the requested number of games
   - Display all games in the terminal
   - Show number frequency statistics
   - Create a PDF report

## 📄 Output Format

### Terminal Output
```
Jogo 1: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 24, 25
Jogo 2: 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25
...
```

### PDF Report Content
The generated PDF (`Lt_jogos_gerados_DATE_TIME.pdf`) includes:
- All generated games with numbers
- Detailed number frequency analysis
- Generation date and time
- Complete statistical report

## ⚙️ Technical Details

The script uses several specialized functions:

1. `gerar_jogo_lotofacil()`: Generates a single game
2. `equilibrar_jogos()`: Balances numbers across games
3. `contar_dezenas()`: Analyzes number frequency
4. `equilibrar_frequencia_jogos_e_dezenas()`: Ensures balanced distribution
5. `salvar_resultado_pdf()`: Creates the PDF report
